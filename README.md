# Use JavaScript to Create a "Code Breaker" Game

You'll build a marvellous Code Breaker game using JavaScript. Based off the board game Mastermind, the game will randomly generate a hidden code and the player gets 10 attempts to estimate the given code based on provided feedback.

# Getting Started

To get started with this project, head over to the [Link to Repository](https://www.codeschool.com/projects/CodeBreaker) project on Code School and begin! It'll walk you through all of the steps below. They're included here in the readme in case you work better locally or want to try working on this project offline.

To get set up locally, run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

# Live Demo

[Check out this link] (https://codeschool-projects.github.io/CodeBreakerProject/) to see a working version of this project. Feel free to alter and expand on this project to make your own twist on the Code Breaker game once you've completed the steps.

You'll build a Code Breaker game that you can play and show off to others as an example of your abilities and expertise in JavaScript.

# Setup Instructions

Once you have cloned the forked repository, go into the directory containing the project and look for the `/src` directory. This is the directory where you will be making changes when you start the following step-by-step instructions. You can simply open those files in any text editor to get started.

In this project, all of your changes will happen in the `/src/assets/main.js` file.

# Tasks

Complete the following tasks to finish this project.

## Create `setHiddenFields` function

Create a function named `setHiddenFields` that sets the `answer` variable equal to a randomly generated whole number between 0 and 9999.

**Hint:** `Math.random()` can be used to randomly generate a number between 0 and 1 (up to 18 decimal points) and `Math.floor(input)` can be used to round down to the nearest whole number.

## Make sure the hidden input `answer`'s value is exactly 4 characters long

In our `setHiddenFields` function we need to make sure the hidden input `answer` is exactly 4 characters long. (If our random number generates "42", we want to set the `value` of `answer` to "0042".)

**Hint:** In order to add a zero to the front of an answer, it must be a string, not a number. You can convert numbers to strings with `.toString()`. We can create a `while` loop that runs while `answer.length` is less than 4 that puts a `0` before answer's current value.

## Set the hidden input `attempt`'s value to zero

In our `setHiddenFields` function, we should also set the hidden input `attempt` to `0`.

## Only set the `answer` and `attempt` hidden inputs when they aren't already set

Call the `setHiddenFields` function in the body of the `guess` function, but also write some logic so that it's only called when answer and attempt haven't already been set.

**Hint:** we can use an `if` condition to only run our code when `answer` or `attempt` is empty (`''`).

## Create `setMessage` function

Create a `setMessage` function with one parameter. This function should set the `message` label to whatever is provided to the parameter.

**Hint:** With a label, you'll want to set its `.innerHTML`, not its `.value`.

## Create `validateInput` function

Create a function `validateInput` with one parameter. If the parameter has a `length` of 4, return `true` — otherwise, use the `setMessage` function to set the `message` label to `"Guesses must be exactly 4 characters long."`, then return `false`.

## Call the `validateInput` function from the `guess` function

Create an `if` condition block that uses `validateInput` with a parameter of `input.value` as the conditional. If `validateInput` returns `false`, then use `return false` to stop execution of the `guess` function, otherwise we should increment the `attempt` hidden input by 1.

**Hint:** You can negate a value on the `if` statement by using the exclamation point, like this: `if(!someValue)`.

## Create `getResults` function

Create a `getResults` function that has one parameter. In this function, we need to add the results of the user's guess to our `results` div's `innerHTML`. Each result should begin with `<div class="row"><span class="col-md-6">' + input + '</span><div class="col-md-6">` where `input` is the value the user guessed. Then for each character, you should add `<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span>` if the character is in the correct position in the `answer`, a `<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-transfer"></span>` if the character is in the `answer` but isn't in the right position, and `<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove"></span>` if the number isn't in the `answer` at all. Don't forget to close your divs!

**Hint:*** You can create a variable to hold the initial div, then add each character's results to that variable in a `for` loop, then add the closing `div` tags after the loop. After which you can just set the `results` element's `innerHTML` to that variable.

## Check for correct guess

In our `getResults` function, create a variable that counts how many characters were guessed correctly. If all characters were guessed correctly, the function should return `true`, otherwise `false`.

## Set up win condition

Add a call to the `getResults` function at the end of our `guess` function. If `getResults` returns true, use the `setMessage` function to set the `message` label to `"You Win! :)"`.

## Set up lose condition

If `getResults` returns `false` and the hidden input `attempt` value is greater than or equal to 10, use the `setMessage` function to set the `message` label to `"You Lose! :("`.

## Continue play condition

If neither a win or lose condition is met, use the `setMessage` function to set the `message` label to `"Incorrect, try again."`.

## Create a `showAnswer` function

Create a function `showAnswer` that has one parameter. This function should set the `innerHTML` of the `code` label to the `value` of the `answer` hidden input. In addition to this, it should take the parameter as a `true` or `false` (indicating if the player won or lost) if the parameter is `true` add ` success` to `code`'s `className` — otherwise, it should add ` failure`. (Note the space before ` success` and ` failure`.)

## Create a `showReplay` function

Create a function `showReplay` with no parameters. This function will change the `style.display` of `guessing-div` div to `none` and the `style.display` of the `replay-div` div to `block`, making it so the user can start over after they win or lose the game.

## Add `showAnswer` and `showReplay` to win / lose conditions

When a player wins in addition to `setMessage` call, they should also call `showAnswer` passing `true` for its parameter, and finally make a call to `showReplay`. When the player loses, they should call `showAnswer` with `false` for the parameter and then `showReplay`.

# Next Steps

Now that you've completed this project, you should make it available online so you can share your progress with others! One way to do this is by using GitHub Pages.

To deploy your `/src` directory to GitHub Pages, be sure to commit all of your changes and make a new branch called `gh-pages`. Once you are checked in to the `gh-pages` branch, run the following command:

```git subtree push --prefix src origin gh-pages```

This will push the `src` folder up to GitHub on the `gh-pages` branch. After that, you should be able to open up `http://username.github.io/CodeBreakerProject`, where `username` is your GitHub username.
